            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are pleaſed to begin with me thus, <hi>Although your Tract be of another Subject, which wiſe and learned men hold unworthy of Anſwer; yet finding a little waſte Paper at the end of this Treatiſe, I am content to fill it up with a few words touching your</hi> No Neceſsity, <hi>&amp;c. to ſave further labour about it in another way. You are pleaſed (under the guiſe of a</hi> Brotherly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Chriſtian Moderation) <hi>to make ſport with the Authors of the</hi> Reaſons of a Neceſsity of Reformation of the Publick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>&amp;c. wherein you ſet up Shawfowles of your own (calling them ours) and then ſhoot at them as you liſt, which you call</hi> Anſwers <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.

Therefore, at preſent, take theſe Generals, till you more rationally make out your Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that I am reſolved to proceed with a <hi>Brotherly temper,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Moderation,</hi> as being not at all diſcouraged with any miſinterpretation of ſuch reall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and leſt I ſhould ſeem to ſet up <hi>Shawfowles of my own,</hi> (as I am accuſed, how deſervedly let the Reader judge,) I ſhall repreſent your words as they lie in your Poſtſcript, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn my Anſwer to them.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>We place not the</hi> Neceſſity of Reformation, <hi>in the</hi> not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing <hi>the Doctrine of our Church, by</hi> Law; <hi>but, our work is to ſhew,</hi> 1. <hi>that there is no neceſſity of ſubſcription, by vertue of the act of</hi> 13. Eliz. 12. <hi>becauſe that, thereby, thoſe Articles now urged, do not appear to be by that Law eſtabliſhed.</hi> 2. <hi>That as they now ſtand, and as now worded, they ought not to be eſtabliſhed, untill they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But, you make us ſpeak that we never ſo much as dreamt of, nor ever mentioned in our</hi> Reaſons : <hi>and ſo, you fight onely with your own ſhadow. Let them part you, that have a mind to it: we have other buſineſſe to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt words of this Paragraph, <hi>We place not the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Reformation in the not eſtabliſhing the Doctrine of our Church by Law;</hi> I anſwer, it is well you do not: it ſeemeth my Treatiſe hath prevailed ſomething with you; for in your former Book you did place the Neceſſity of Reformation of the Publick Doctrine of the Church in the Non-eſtabliſhment by Law. The truth, of which thus I prove. <hi>In what you did place the Doubtfulneſſe of the Articles, in that you did place the Neceſſity of Reformation.</hi> This is a clear Proportion. For having firſt propounded REASONS SHEWING the Neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Doctrine, you argue thus. The Doctrine <hi>is ſaid to be contained in the</hi> 39 . <hi>Articles; but thoſe Articles are both Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Defective.</hi> Therefore you did place the Neceſsity of Reformation in the Doubtfulneſs of the Articles. Neither can you with any reaſon deny you did ſo, becauſe in the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of thisPoſtſcript, your own words are theſe. <hi>We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a Neceſſity of Reformation,</hi> 1. <hi>from the Doubtfulneſs,</hi> 2. <hi>from the Defect of the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles.</hi> Now I ſubſume, <hi>In the Non-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by Law you did place the Doubtfulneſſe of the Articles.</hi> This alſo is a clear Propoſition; for thus you proceeded in your Argument, 1. <hi>Doubtfull, becauſe it appears not that they were all or any of them confirmed by Parliament in the</hi> 13. Eliz. From theſe two Propoſitions, as Premiſſes, neceſſarily followeth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>In the Non-eſtabliſhment by Law, you did place the Neceſſity of Reformation.</hi> Since therefore my Treatiſe, you profeſs not to place the Neceſſity of Reformation in that in which before you placed it; and before I have done treating of this Subject, I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168967:3"/>ſhall not deſpaire of perſwading you to place the <hi>Necefſsity of</hi> this <hi>Reformation</hi> no where.</p>
            <p>To the next words of this Paragraph, <hi>But our work is to ſhew, Firſt, that there is no neceſſity of ſubſcription by virtue of the Act of</hi> 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 12. <hi>becauſe that thereby thoſe Articles now urged doe not appear to be by that Law eſtabliſhed.</hi> I anſwer, Your propoſall was, There is a Neceſſity of Reformation, <hi>your work,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is to ſhew that there is no Neceſſity of Subſcription;</hi> therefore your propoſall is one thing, and your work is another. Whereas one would imagine that <hi>the work</hi> of him which writes ſhould be <hi>to ſhew</hi> that which he profeſſeth to write of. You pretend to give Reaſons of Neceſſity of Reformation, and you labour to prove there is no neceſſity of ſubſeription. And yet the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you render of no Neceſſity of Subſcription is, <hi>becauſe the Articles doe not appear to be eſtabliſhed by Law,</hi> while you ſay your ſelf you doe <hi>not place</hi> the Neceſſity of Reformation in their Non-eſtabliſhment by Law. What agreement is this?</p>
            <p>To the next words of the ſame Paragraph, <hi>As they now ſtand, and as now worded, they ought not to be eſtabjſhed untill they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> I anſwer firſt, that this preſent <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>wording</hi> of the Articles is new language not heard of in your former Diſcourſe; by which it appears that you have a mind to alter your way of reaſoning againſt them, as you had need; your firſt having ſo ill ſucceſſe. Secondly, that the preſent <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>wording</hi> of the Articles I look upon as that which is no way ſubjet to reprehenſion, for that very <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>wording,</hi> which you particularly oppoſe, ſhew the Articles to be the ſame which were agreed upon in the Convocation 1562. to which the ſubſcription was required and enacted by a Law, as I have already proved. Thirdly, whereas you ſay <hi>they ought not to be eſtabliſhed,</hi> if you mean any new eſtabliſhment, they need it not, becauſe they are eſtabliſhed by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in full force, according to an agreement made by a full and legall Convocation, and a greater eſtabliſhment then this is not to be had in this Church or Kingdome: if you mean a continuation of eſtabliſhment, that they ought no longer to ſtand eſtabliſhed; you doe in ſome ſenſe oppoſe your ſelf to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168967:4"/>the whole Clergy; for as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> writes, in his 4. <hi>Inſt. cap.</hi> 74. <hi>In domo Convocationis, the whole Clergy of either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince are either preſent in perſon or repreſentation;</hi> and not onely to the Clergy, but the whole Realme: for as the ſame Learned Lord Chief Juſtice teacheth us in his 4. <hi>Inſt, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>The Court</hi> of Parliament <hi>conſiſteth of the Kings Majeſty ſitting there as in his Royall politick capacity, and of the three Eſtates of the Realme,</hi> one of which he ſaith <hi>repreſenteth all the Commons of the whole Realme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the remainder of the Paragraph, I deny that I <hi>make you ſpeake</hi> any thing which you <hi>never mentioned in your Reaſons:</hi> and whenſoever you ſhall produce any ſuch particular, I will make my deniall good.</p>
            <p>Your Second <hi>Generall</hi> is this. <hi>We argue a Neceſſity of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> I. <hi>From the</hi> Doubtfulneſs; 2. <hi>From the Defect of the</hi> 39. Articles. <hi>But you will needs have us to ſpeake in a ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our meaning. We doubt not of the</hi> Doctrines <hi>themſelves, rightly explained; but of the</hi> Words <hi>wherein they are ſet forth. For, the</hi> Words <hi>(which ſhould be clear) being ambiguous, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of more</hi> ſenſes, <hi>then one; and ſo, may be, and are wreſted to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize Errours. Therefore they ought to be</hi> reformed <hi>by ſuch an Orthodox explanation, as may diſtinctly and poſitively expreſſe the true ſenſe of the Church; and not left ſo homonymous and equivocal, as to countenance thoſe Errours which we believe the Church of</hi> England <hi>diſclaimeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt part of which Paragraph I anſwer; that you did ſo <hi>argue</hi> I confeſs, that you made good any Argument I deny: and that I would have you <hi>ſpeake in a ſenſe contrary to your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> I alſo deny, if you mean what you ſay. To urge a Neceſsity of Reformation of Doctrine, in regard of the Doubtfulneſt, and at the ſame time to ſay, <hi>We doubt not of the Doctrines;</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me very ſtrange: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o doubt of that which we declare doubtfull, or to declare that doubtfull of which we doubt nor, being equally unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>As for your way of ſalving this Contradidion, <hi>We doubt not of the Doctrines themſelves, rightly explained; but of the Words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are ſet forth,</hi> I ſhall earneſtly contend and evidently ſhew
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168967:4"/>that it will no way ſalve it; for if you doubt of the <hi>Words, wherein</hi> the Dodrine <hi>is ſet forth,</hi> you muſt doubt what is the Doctrine which is ſet forth in the <hi>Words:</hi> and the Reaſon is plain, becauſe the Doctrine which is ſet forth in the <hi>Words is</hi> nothing elſe but the meaning of the <hi>Words</hi> in which it is ſet forth. When you ſay you doubt of the <hi>Words,</hi> it is not a doubt whether ſuch words be in the Article or no, but whether the <hi>Words</hi> have this or that ſenſe as they ſtand in the Article. If this or that ſenſe make no variation in the Doctrine, then the Doubt of the ſenſe is no way Materiall; if this or that ſenſe make a variation in the Doctrine, then a doubt of the ſenſe muſt be a doubt of the Doctrine. In vain therefore do you pretend, <hi>not to doubt of the Doctrines themſelves rightly explained, while you profeſs to doubt of the Words wherein they are ſet forth,</hi> becauſe while you doubt of the true meaning of the <hi>Words,</hi> you muſt alſo doubt whether they be rightly explained: for the true meaning of the words and the right explaining is the ſame thing. Either therefore ſay you doubt not of the Doctrines, and doubt not of the <hi>Words,</hi> or elſe ſay you doubt of the Words, and doubt what are the Doctrines: for to ſay you doubt of the one and doubt not of the other is a Contradiction; except you could find in the Articles Doctrines without words.</p>
            <p>The next words of the Paragraph are very farre from any truth in their Aſſertion, and farther (if it be poſsible) in their Collection. For the firſt, you ſay the <hi>Words are very ambiguous, and capable of more ſenſes then one,</hi> and I ſay it is to be believed that there are not ſo many Words in any ſo many Doctrinall Aſſertions in the world, which are not as ambiguous and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of as many ſenſes as they are. For the ſecond, you ſay the <hi>Words may be and are wreſted to patronize Errours;</hi> and I ſay, ſo are the words of the Scripture, or elſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not truth.</p>
            <p>But when follow with your earneſtneſs of Reformation, you clearly diſcover the weakneſs of your Argumentation in theſe words, <hi>Therefore they ought to be reformed by ſuch an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox explanation;</hi> for there may be an explanation of that (and that explanation Orthodox) which cannot be reformed. I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168967:5"/>hope you think not of Reforming the Scriptures, and yet I hope if you have an occaſion to explain them, you will do it Orthodoxly. If therefore you have occaſion to give an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox explication of an Article, do not imagin that you have Neceſsity to reform it. The poſsibility of being <hi>wreſted to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize Errours</hi> toucheth no more the <hi>Words</hi> of the Articles then the Word of God, which we are aſſured the <hi>ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> may <hi>wreſt,</hi> and we are not aſſured that any other can wreſt the <hi>Words</hi> of the Articles, but ſuch as can wreſt the Word of God.</p>
            <p>As for the laſt words of this Paragraph, touching <hi>Errours which you believe the Church of England diſclaimeth,</hi> I confeſs I know not how well to anſwer them, for this reaſon, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe I know not what you believe. Neither can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that you will believe either Church or Parliament, when you deny any Sacriledge of things not required by God by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command, or given by his ſpecial warrant, in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to this Parliament, which hath unanimouſly declared Sacrilege in the taking away the Utenſils of the Church, which you can never prove were expreſly commanded by God, or given by his ſpecial warrant.</p>
            <p>Your third <hi>Generall,</hi> if I may ſo call it, is this. <hi>In our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtances of</hi> Defects <hi>in the</hi> 39. Articles, <hi>we deny not any truths contained in them; but onely ſhew what miſ-conſtructions are, or may be made of them, as now they be worded. Therefore our purpoſe is not to preſs the rejecting of them, as to the matter, but onely as to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we deſire may be reformed by amending of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that as often as I read this Paragraph, I might queſtion my ſelf whether I underſtand any thing of this Controverſie or no. When I conſider the matter of it, I am ſo kind to my ſelf as to imagin I underſtand it; when I conſider the Author, I am ſo kind to you, as to ſuſpect my ſelf to be miſtaken; for if I be not, there is not onely, no truth, but no ſenſe in it. For, what do theſe words ſignifie, <hi>In our particular inſtances of Defects in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles, we deny not any truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them?</hi> Is it poſsible to deny any truths contained in the Articles by any particular inſtances of defects in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168967:5"/>Is a Defect any thing elſe then a Negation of ſomething which you conceive ſhould be in them, and can a ſuppoſed Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; of that which ſhould be in them, cauſe a falſity of that which is really in them? In brief, I abſolutely deny that by any particular inſtances <hi>Defects,</hi> you have or can <hi>ſhew</hi> any <hi>miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions</hi> in the Articles, <hi>as now they be worded.</hi> And if by ſuch <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> you: cannot ſhew ſuch <hi>miſconſtructions,</hi> you cannot with any reaſon upon the ſame <hi>Defects, preſs the rejecting</hi> of the Articles, <hi>as to the expreſsions.</hi> For example, you ſay the Articles contain nothing of the Doctrine of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and this you urge as a Defect. Now I ask, What <hi>miſconſtruction</hi> can: you <hi>ſhew</hi> in any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle by vertue of this ſuppoſed <hi>defect?</hi> or what <hi>expreſsion</hi> can therefore render any Article fit to be rejected, for this reaſon onely becauſe it containeth nothing of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If there be no other <hi>miſconſtructions</hi> in the Articles then what ariſe from that which is not in the Articles, if there be no other <hi>expreſsions as now they are worded</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but ſuch as are not contained, we may ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Articles in and of themſelves to be in no great danger of miſconſtructions, and to contain in them no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectable expreſsions.</p>
            <p>Your fourth <hi>Generall</hi> is this, <hi>Whereas we aſſert that many neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Doctrines are wanting in thoſe</hi> 39. Articles, <hi>we intend not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to reject, any of the</hi> Articles <hi>themſelves (ſo far as they concur with the holy Scriptures:) but, the</hi> Reformation <hi>we deſire this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is onely an Addition of thoſe neceſſary Truths, duly ſet forth and explained, as may make the Publick Doctrine of our Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, before</hi> Subſcription <hi>to thoſe few, as if they were all which our Church, will own. Here, we ſay again, that a neceſſary</hi> Addition <hi>is properly a</hi> Reformation <hi>of that which is defective, to make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that while you ſay, <hi>you intend not to reject any of the Articles</hi> (<hi>ſo far as they concur with the holy Scriptures,</hi>) you might have, ſaid as much of other things, no way ſo much concerning as the Publick Doctrine; the Queſtion is, whether you do believe the Articles do condur with the holy Scriptures, and when you give your unfeigned aſſent, you are ſuppoſed to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168967:6"/>ſo much; you know what was reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that he which ſubſcribed the 39. Articles, with this Addition, (<hi>ſo far as the ſame are agreeable to the Word of God</hi>) <hi>might by his own private opinion take ſome of them to be against the Word of God.</hi> While therefore you make that profeſsion only, that you <hi>intend not to reject them</hi> with that limitation, ye may at the ſame time intend to reject any of them; becauſe you may at the ſame time believe that they concur not with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reformation you deſire is onely an Addition,</hi> and I ſay, that whatſoever is onely an Addition, is not a Reformation: For whereſoever there is a Reformation, ſomething muſt be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But where there is onely an Addition, there is nothing reformed. For if any thing were thereby reformed, it muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be that which is added, or that to which it is added: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is added is at all reformed by only being added, neither is that to which it is added at all reformed by the ſole adding of ſomething to it; which hath no other operation on it, to which it is added.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſpeak of <hi>making the Publick Doctrine of our Church compleat, before</hi> Subſcription <hi>to thoſe few, as if they were all which our Church will own.</hi> So far as I underſtand your words (for to ſay the truth, what coherence you intend thoſe words <hi>[before Subſcription to thoſe few]</hi> I do not apprehend) you ſeem to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the Subject of the Queſtion, that is, the Nature of the Book of Articles, and the deſign of the Church in agreeing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, them, and ſubſcribing to them. For the Book of Articles is not, nor is pretended to be, a compleat Body of Divinity, or a Comprehenſion and Explication of all Chriſtian Doctrines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be taught; but an Enumeration of ſome Truths, which upon and ſince the Reformation have been denyed by ſome perſons, who upon their deny all are thought unfit to have any cure of ſouls in this Church or Realme, becauſe they might by their opinions, either infect their flock, with error, or elſe diſturbe the Church with ſchiſm; or the Realm with ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This appeareth by the Title of the firſt Articles agreed upon in the year 1552. <hi>for the avoiding of Controverſie in opinions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168967:6"/>and the eſtabliſhment of a godly Concord, in certain matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> If therefore ſome Neceſſary Doctrine of Religion in which all agree, or ſome other Doctrine in which an explicite conſent or agreement in all the Paſtors of the Church is not neceſſary, be not contained in the Articles; it doth render them no way defective, becauſe they cannot be ſaid thereby to want any thing for which they were intended. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you <hi>ſay again, that a Neceſſary Addition is properly a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> firſt I deny your Addition to be neceſſary, and then I ſay again, that ſuch an Addition to the Articles would be no more a Reformation of the Articles, then the Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> is a Reformation of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> then <hi>Joſhuah</hi> a Reformation of the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then the addition of the <hi>Judges</hi> was a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the addition of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, the Reformation of St. <hi>Matthew's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your fifth <hi>Generall</hi> followed) thus, <hi>Whereas you ſtruggle to prove that the</hi> 39. Articles <hi>do include many, if not all of thoſe</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines <hi>which we hold needfull to be added; We admit that ſome of them are touch'd upon by name, but not explained as the nature of the things requireth; and, as thoſe points be, which are the ſubjects of the</hi> 39. Articles. <hi>If then, the naming them, on the by, be enough to prove that there is no need of more; then the bare naming of the Titles of the</hi> 39. Articles, <hi>had been ſufficient, without the body of the</hi> Articles <hi>themſelves: or elſe, thoſe other Doctrines which are but named, ought to be explained as well as the other: Or, no ſubſeription to be urged, but onely to the holy Scriptures themſelves, which are infallible, and contain all Doctrines neceſſary to ſalvation. To what purpoſe then, is that aſſertion, that the</hi> Creed <hi>being mentioned in the</hi> Articles, <hi>there is no need of adding more Articles, becauſe they are comprehended within the</hi> Creed; <hi>or, named in the</hi> 39. Articles?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that, when you ſay, <hi>you admit that ſome of the Doctrines are touch'd upon by name,</hi> and <hi>not explained as the Nature of the things requireth;</hi> you deny that which is true, and admit that which is falſe. For thoſe Doctrines which I inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, ſaying and proving that it was not true which you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of them, (viz. <hi>that the Articles contain nothing of them</hi>) are not <hi>touch'd upon by name,</hi> but expreſſed in the <hi>Nature</hi> of them.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168967:7"/>The firſt Article I affirmed to contain ſomething of <hi>the Creation,</hi> but it does not touch <hi>upon the name.</hi> The 17. Article I affirmed to contain ſomething of <hi>Effectuall calling,</hi> in which the <hi>name</hi> is not mentioned, but the <hi>nature</hi> of it delivered. The 35. Article I affirmed to contain ſomething of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> which doth not ſo much as <hi>touch upon the name</hi> of either, but confirmeth the Homilies which treateth fully of the <hi>nature</hi> of each. Whereas you ſay, they <hi>are touch'd upon by name, but not explained, as thoſe Points be which are the Subjects of the</hi> 39. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> this is alſo untrue in the Doctrine of <hi>Sin;</hi> for that which I alleadged was the very <hi>ſubject</hi> of three Articles, 9.15.16. and one Homily; and as untrue in the Doctrine of the <hi>Law,</hi> for that which I alleadged, was not the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but the whole <hi>ſubject</hi> of the 7. Article. All your diſcourſe, therefore which followeth being grounded upon the bare <hi>naming</hi> of thoſe Doctrines, muſt neceſſarily prove inconſequentiall, becauſe the bare <hi>naming</hi> of them, upon which it was grounded, is a fiction.</p>
            <p>To the latter part of the Paragraph, where you aske that Queſtion, <hi>To what purpoſe is that Aſſertion, that the Creed being mentioned in the Articles, there is no need of adding more Articles?</hi> I anſwer, it is far more proper for me to aske, to what purpoſe is that Queſtion? for there was no ſuch Aſſertion delivered by me. All which I ſpake was onely to ſhew the inconſequence of your diſcourſe, who undertaking to prove that the Articles <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing of</hi> 20. <hi>neceſſary Doctrines,</hi> argued them all to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe <hi>moſt of them were comprized in the Creed</hi> (which you know is certainly falſe)und from thence and upon no other ground endeavoured to infer your Concluſion, that the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles contained nothing of thoſe Doctrines, when you know that they contain the Creed. You cannot therefore juſtly charge me with any ſuch <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> when of that diſcourſe I onely ſaid, that it ſeemed to me a very ſtrange Objection, and ſo I may ſay it ſeemeth ſtill. Make not therefore any <hi>Aſſertions</hi> for me; but free your own Argumentation firſt from thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths with which I charged it; endeavour to ſhew that the moſt part of the 20. Doctrines mentioned by you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168967:7"/>in the Creed; which I abſolutely deny: Prove if your can that, becauſe ſome of them are comprized in the Creed, therefore for that reaſon (for no other is mentioned) all the reſt muſt be acknowledged to be neceſſary; which I alſo deny: Shew that being comprized in the Creed, the Articles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Creed, and the Expoſitions of the Creed <hi>contain nothing</hi> of them, which I thirdly deny: and when you have proved them, I will give you leave to fix what <hi>Aſſertion</hi> you pleaſe upon me.</p>
            <p>Your ſixth <hi>Generall</hi> followeth, <hi>As for your many Quibbles and Retortions, (all built upon theſe ſandy foundations) I ſhall value them no more then you value us. Onely that miſtake of the</hi> Homily <hi>in point of Title, may be pardoned, when your ſelf confeſſe the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: We were far from our Books, and ſo might miſtake the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the</hi> Homily. <hi>But, ſo long as we have not falſified the matter, which you dare not to juſtifie, but acknowledge</hi> not to be proper <hi>(and which we affirm to be abſurd and falſe;) we leave it to all to judge, whether that be</hi> a godly and wholeſome Doctrine, neceſſary for theſe times. <hi>And if it be not; then whether there be not</hi> a neceſſity of Reforming <hi>that</hi> 35 th. Article, <hi>as to that point of the</hi> Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
            <p>For my <hi>Quibbles,</hi> and thoſe <hi>many,</hi> I ſhall not deſire you to <hi>value</hi> them, but I intreat you to ſhew them. I beſeech you be plain with me; declarewhat they are, and ſhame me with them. For the <hi>Retortions,</hi> if you mean by them my Anſwers, I could wiſh you would <hi>value</hi> them ſo far as to give them a civill reply; howſoever I am reſolved ſo far to <hi>value you</hi> and your writings. The <hi>miſtake of the Homily</hi> in point of Title is eaſily <hi>pardon'd,</hi> the rather, becauſe it is the leaſt of your miſtakes; for, even in this particular, though you have not <hi>falſified the matter;</hi> that is, the words produced, yet you have miſtaken the Argument; and though I have plainly ſhew'd your miſtake, you refuſe to rectifie it. I did clearly diſtingniſh between the Doctrines delivered in the Articles, and the Illuſtrations of them; I did ſhew that the 35. Article did binde us to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the one, and doth not require us to maintain the other; I did make it appear that your Objections did no way
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168967:8"/>touch the Doctrine of the Homilies, but were onely againſt ſome expreſſions in the Illuſtrations or accumulated autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities: when I had ſhewn all this, you vouchſafe no anſwer to it all, but <hi>leave it to all to judge,</hi> and I make no Queſtion but the judgement is eaſie; for it is no more then this, <hi>That the people ought to read the Scriptures</hi> is a godly and wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: This is the onely Doctrine of one of the Homilies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. <hi>That it is profitable for a wan to exerciſe himſelf in Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds,</hi> is a godly and wholeſome Doctrine; this is the onely Doctrine of the other Homily accuſed. The Articles ſpeake of nothing elſe but the Doctrine of the Homilies: therefore there appeared no neceſſity of reforming the 35th. Article, as to that part of the Homilies.</p>
            <p>Your ſeventh <hi>Generall</hi> is this, <hi>As touching the Regal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we own and will aſſert it as far as you do, or dare. Onely we had reaſon to take notice of the improper Expreſſion in the</hi> 37. Article, <hi>that</hi> the Queens Majeſty hath the Supreme Power. <hi>For, if the</hi> Declaration <hi>fathered on the late King, and prefixed to the</hi> Articles, <hi>had ſo much power with his</hi> Printer, <hi>that he durſt net to alter the word</hi> Queen, <hi>into</hi> King, <hi>even in the year</hi> 1642. <hi>and, thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles muſt be read</hi> verbatim, <hi>without alteration or explanation; then, we ſay again, there is a neceſſity, of reforming that Article in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it: and not to talk at randome what was indeed the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſſe we may have leave, when we read it,</hi> (Regia Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione non obſtante) <hi>to declare the ſenſe; which the</hi> Declaration <hi>alloweth us not to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Reſolution to aſſert the <hi>Regal Supremacy,</hi> I am glad to hear; but how the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> in the 37. Article ſhould be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,</hi> I cannot underſtand. The Article was made in the year 1562. the Subſcription is required to the Article made in that year, by the Act of the 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> The <hi>Expreſſion</hi> which you call <hi>improper</hi> is, <hi>the Queens Majeſty hath the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> and is this <hi>improper</hi> in an Article acknowledged to be made in that year? was there not then a Queen which had the <hi>Supreme Power;</hi> that is to ſay, a Queen Regnant?</p>
            <p>As for your expreſſion <hi>of the Declaration fathered on the late King,</hi> it ſeemeth to me much more <hi>improper.</hi> I believe you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168967:8"/>cannot prove but that Declaration was His own, as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Declaration was His or any King's. And for a Subject to ſpeak ſo of His King, or to judge and declare what Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is His, and what is not, is certainly at leaſt very <hi>improper.</hi> That pious King and bleſſed Martyr, was too often thus uſed; but never that I know by any that profeſſed themſelves ſo <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> to aſſert His Regal Supremacy as you do. His Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were denyed to be His; though aſſerted, framed, pend by himſelf; His Book denyed to be His, though none could pen it but himſelf: He was denyed to have declared what He did conſtantly profeſs, to have written what He wrote, to have ſpoken what He ſpake; and at laſt ſure ſome will deny Him to have ſuffered what He endured.</p>
            <p>But as to that conceit of yours, that this Declaration <hi>had ſo much power with the Printer, that he durſt not to alter the word</hi> Queen <hi>into</hi> King <hi>even in the year</hi> 1642. it ſeems to me ſo ſtrange, that I cannot imagine that you ever conſidered it when you wrote it: you are ſo angry with the Declaration, that it muſt be guilty of every thing. The Articles were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times Printed after the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and before the Declaration of <hi>Charles</hi> I. and in them you will find the word <hi>Queen</hi> not turned into the word <hi>King;</hi> and I pray you, what <hi>power</hi> hid the Kings Declaration with the Printers then? They were printed by <hi>Robert Norton</hi> 1612. by <hi>Bonham Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>John Bill</hi> 1624. both Editions have the words as they were in the Queens time, and yet there was no Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then to inforce them not to alter the words. Do you imagin that the Printers had any power to alter the words of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Church, if there were no Declaration to preſerve them entire? Aſſure your ſelf, it was not the <hi>Power</hi> of the Kings Declaration, but the duty of the Printer which cauſed him not to vary from his Copy: from which none of the Printers from die death of the Queen did ever vary, and that for the ſame cauſe. I beſeeeh you therefore, Sir, acknowledg the Declaration to be the Kings, as Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> did, and ſay not that it was <hi>father'd</hi> upon that bleſſed Martyr, which Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> himſelf would not endure; and when you have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168967:9"/>that the Declaration was the Kings, acknowledge alſo that it was not the cauſe of the continuation of the words of the Articles, becauſe thoſe words were conſtantly continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Declaration; and which is more, the Declaration it ſelfe gives not any command expreſly for the words, but onely for the <hi>Literall</hi> and <hi>Grammaticall ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Printer hath done his part to print the <hi>Queens Majeſty,</hi> according to his Copie; The Incumbent, without any other Act of Parliament for alteration of thoſe words, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an annulling of the Kings Declaration, may reade the <hi>Kings Majeſty,</hi> and not thereby be in danger of any Law; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is clear, becauſe the <hi>Kings Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>Queens Majeſty</hi> (ſpeaking of a Queen regnant, as the Article ſpeaketh) is the ſame thing in the Law. For you may be pleaſed to take notice what was declared by the ſecond Parliament, 1 <hi>Mariae cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Be it declared and enacted by the Authority of this preeſnt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the Laws of this Realm is and ever hath bin and ought to be underſtand, that the Kingly or Regal Office of this Realm, and all Dignities, Prerogative, Royal Power, Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umencer, Priviledges, Authorities and Juriſdictions thereunto annexed, united or belonging, being inveſted either in Male or Female, are, and be, and ought to be, as fully, wholly, abſolutely and entirely déemed, judged, accepted, inveſted and taken in the one as in the other, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Commentaries upon the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>de Proditioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> making it Treaſon <hi>to imagine the death of our Lord the King,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a Queen Regnant is within theſe words</hi> [Noſtre Seignior le Roy <hi>for ſhe hath the Office of a King:</hi> and whereas the ſame Statute maketh it Treaſon to imagine the death of the Kings <hi>eldeſt Son and Heir,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that the eldeſt Son and Heir of a Queen Regnant is within this Law.</hi> Being then the Law maketh no diſtinction between a King and a Queen Regnant, being it looketh not upon the Sex, which may be different, but upon the Office which is wholly the ſame in either Sex, beeing the Doctrine of the Church is wholly agreeable with the Law of the Land in this particular; therefore there needeth no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this caſe, becauſe whatſoever aſſertion is ſet forth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168967:9"/>concerning the Sovereign power, if it be ſpoken in the life of a Queen and in the Title of a Queen, it may be alſo ſpoken in the life of a King, in the title of a King: if it be aſſerted in the life time of a King under the Title of a King, it may be ſpoken in the life of a Queen under the Title of a Queen, and that without fear of the breach of any Law of the Land or Doctrine of the Church. Aſſure your ſelf therefore, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Act of the 13. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and notwithſtanding the Declaration of <hi>Charles</hi> I. you may yet read in the Articles, <hi>the Kings Majeſty,</hi> and there is no neceſſity of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make or juſtifie that alteration.</p>
            <p>Your laſt Paragraph is this, <hi>As concerning the</hi> Law-<hi>part, though you ſtrain hard, yet I hold it not worth one line of Reply, till you have anſwered the four</hi> Queries <hi>propounded in page</hi> 61. <hi>and</hi> 62. <hi>of our Book. Not that I would wave ought which deſerveth Anſwer; but, to ſpare labour where it would be, in the judgement of wiſe men, ridiculous to beſtow it. This is ſpoken in love to the truth, and to your ſelf alſo, by</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Servant (and Brother, if you pleaſe) <hi>C. B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RGES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer Firſt, that till you Anſwer that <hi>Law-part,</hi> I ſhall take it to be unanſwerable, as, to uſe your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>many wiſe and learned men</hi> do. 2. The condition requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by you is very ſtrange, that you will not anſwer my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe till I have anſwered thoſe four Queries, when one of the four hath no kind of Relation to the Articles, and the Ground of another concerns them not. But, that, (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) I may obtain a ſerious Reply from you, to what I nave delivered concerning the Legall Confirmation of our Publick Doctrine, I will here punctually anſwer to the Queries ſo far as they concern the Articles, which are now in queſtion; and do further promiſe that I will anſwer the reſt of the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo farre as they concern any other ſubject, when I come to treat of that ſubject which they concern.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:168967:10"/>
            <p>Your firſt Quere (as to the Articles,) runs thus page 61. <hi>Whither, if there be anything of ſubſtance altered in or added to the Articles, and thoſe Alterations not expreſſely mentioned and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Parliament; this doth not make thoſe Articles to be void in Law, if pleaded in Law? The Ground of this Quere is the Act of the</hi> 13. Eliz. This is the <hi>Quere</hi> and the <hi>ground;</hi> but how that Act ſhould be produced as the Ground of that Quere, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee. The Act relateth to the Subſcription of the Articles, the Ground of the Quere is a ſuppoſed alteration of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; (for if the Articles were not altered, to what purpoſe is the Quere?) and certainly Alteration and Subſcription are two ſeverall things. It is required by the Law, that every perſon admitted to a Benefice with cure do declare his aſſent unto <hi>all the Articles compriſed in a Book imprinted with a certain Title;</hi> if thoſe Articles ſo compriſed be pleaded in Law, they can be no way voided in Law, if any other1 Articles ſhould be pleaded in the place of them, ſuch Articles ſo plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I conceive, might be voided; but that would be little to your purpoſe, becauſe the true Articles meant by the Law, might ſtill be pleaded. If a man ſhould read the old true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and ſhould be accuſed for not reading Articles ſet forth ſince with additions or ſubſtantiall alterations, I make no queſtion but the plea would be void. But if he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired without Law to read a Book with-alterations, and ſhould omit to read a Book which hath no ſubſtantiall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is required by Law; I ſuppoſe, the Statute would be of force againſt him. But howſoever, I do abſolutety deny that there is any ſubſtantiall alteration of, or addirion to thoſe Articles mentioned in the Act of 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and do aſſert that, the Articles, to which the late Kings Declaration was affixed, are the ſame with them in number, nature, ſubſtance, words; as I am aſſured having my ſelf diligently collated them with an Edition of the Articles printed by <hi>Richard Jugge,</hi> and <hi>John Cawood,</hi> Printers to the Queens Majeſty in <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1571. Being therefore the Articles enjoyned to be read by a Law, have received no alteration; I anſwer your Quere, that <hi>they cannot be voided in Law if pleaded in Law.</hi>

            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:168967:10"/>
            <p>The ſecond Quere having onely reference in it ſelf to the Alterations which I have denyed, and having no reference in the Ground to the Articles at all, can require no further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer here, where the Articles, onely are concern'd.</p>
            <p>The third Quere is this, <hi>If any man be indicted or ſued at Law upon the Statute of</hi> 13. Eliz. <hi>for not reading the Articles of</hi> 1562. <hi>and the Defendant plead Not guilty, and deny theſe Articles to be thoſe confirmed by that Law, till the Plaintiff prove them to be of Record; whether is not the Plaintiff bound to prove that, and in the meane time the Defendant not puniſhable by that Statute. The Grounds of this Quere are, firſt; that there are no Records of theſe to be found; ſecondly, the Book hath been ſeverall times altered ſince that Act; and thirdly, many puniſhed upon the ſaid Acts, becauſe that Book hath been generally received and uſed as eſtabliſhed by Law.</hi> There are ſo many miſtakes in this Quere, and theſe ſeverall Grounds, that it will be very difficult to ſhew them all; firſt, the ſuppoſition of the Quere is incongruous, as implying that which is contrary to the proceedings in this caſe; for if any Perſon inducted into a Benefice do neglect or refuſe to read his Articles according to the Statute of 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he is not to be <hi>indicted</hi> or <hi>ſued at Law,</hi> and ſo as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi> to <hi>pleade Not guilty,</hi> but upon proof made in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Court that he hath not read thoſe Articles, he muſt be forthwith deprived according to that Statute, which ſaith, that he ſhall be upon that <hi>default</hi> ipſo facto <hi>immediately depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> That this is to be done by ſentence Declaratory before the Biſhop of the Dioceſe, and that this is the ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in caſe of an Offendor againſt that Statute, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the proceedings againſt <hi>John Durſton,</hi> mentioned in 6. part of Sir <hi>Edward Coke's</hi> Reports, page 29. in <hi>Greenes</hi> caſe, whole words are theſe. <hi>Le Seignior Pawlet</hi> 6. Aprilis 1574. <hi>Preſent al dit eſgliſe un</hi> John Durſton, <hi>que a ceo fuit admit inſtitute &amp; induct, &amp; ne lia les Articles ſolonque leſtatute de</hi> 13. Eliz. cap. 12. <hi>Per quel cauſe</hi> 10. Martii 1583. <hi>al ſuit del dit Thomas Seignior Pawlet, il fuit deprive per ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Declaratory devant Levesque.</hi> Being therefore the Nature of the Statute is ſuch, that the proof is not put on the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168967:11"/>Plaintiff but on the Defendant, who is bound to read the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles enjoyned by the Statute, and if he be accuſed for not reading, is bound to prove that he hath read them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to produce the Articles which he hath read as thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Statute; it is eaſily anſwered to your Quere, that it ſuppoſeth ſomething wholly inconſiſtent with the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Caſe, and putteth that upon the Plaintiff which belongeth to the Defendant, and therefore the Quere may be wholly denyed in every part of it.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Quere is inconſiſtent to it ſelf, ſo the Grounds arc either falſe in themſelves, or at leaſt no way concerning the intent of the Quere. The firſt Ground I have already refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhewing that the Record, that is, the Originall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles is to be found, and if it were not, the <hi>Articles comprized in a Book imprinted</hi> commanded by the Law to be read, are to be found, which is enough to evacuate the Quere: becauſe it cannot be neceſſary to finde any more then the Act expreſſeth. And if any man reade thoſe Articles which are to be found, it muſt lie upon the Plaintiff to prove that ſuch Articles ſo read, were not the Articles intended in the Statute.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond Ground, that the <hi>Book</hi> of Articles <hi>hath been ſeverall times altered ſince the Act of 13. of Eliz.</hi> It is ſo far from truth, that I can averre, as I have done before, that the Articles now in force are the ſame with the Articles <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in a Book imprinted</hi> when the Act was made, without any the leaſt alteration; and whoſoever readeth either thoſe of 1571. or any Edition printed ſince the Kings Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and giveth his full aſſent to the ſame, ſhall never be in danger of a Declaratory ſentence of Deprivation upon that Statute.</p>
            <p>The third Ground of your Quere, the more of truth it hath in it, hath the leſs of reaſon to Ground the Quere; for the more have been <hi>puniſh'd</hi> upon the <hi>ſaid Act, becauſe the Book hath been generally received as eſtabliſhed by Law</hi> the leſs is it probable that it ſhould not be ſo eſtabliſhed. The Articles are as much enrolled now, as they were when any perſons were puniſhed for not reading them; and it is to be preſumed that they were as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168967:11"/>and carefull to preſerve themſelves in thoſe Benefice into which they inſtituted and inducted, as others are now, and that the Learned of the Law did as well underſtand how to avoid the ſentence of the Statute as now they do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſtant practice to the contrary, is enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any man that your new plea, if there were any ſuch to be admitted, would prove invalid.</p>
            <p>Your fourth Quere concerneth the Canons onely made by the Convocation and ratified by the King, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no preſent reply in this diſcourſe confined to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the 39. Articles.</p>
            <p>Thus far have I ſtept out of my way in anſwer to your Queres, hoping thereby to invite you to a ferious reply to the <hi>Law-part,</hi> at the leaſt, of my Diſcourſe. And though I have omitted that part of your Queres which concern the Common-Prayer and the Canons, it is not at all as if I thought them unanſwerable, but onely becauſe I think it not proper to confound the Subjects of which I intend to treate. I do therefore but reſerve that part of the Queres which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Common-Prayer unto my anſwer to the matter of Worſhip, and that of the Canons, unto the part which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; aſſuring you that by the aſſiſtance of God, I ſhall very ſuddenly ſhew that there is no ſuch Neceſſity of a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Publick Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as you pretend; neither will it be long before I demonſtrate the ſame concerning the Ceremonies and the Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Being near the Concluſion of my Anſwer to your Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, there fell accidentally into my hands a more civil Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs written by <hi>William Hamilton</hi> Gent. who undertakes to be an Interpreter to you and the Miniſters of ſundry Counties, and to defend your Book by altering the State of the Queſtion, and the Concluſion to be proved. I conceive it reaſon at the preſent not to anſwer that Treatiſe, becauſe I am ſure he hath much miſtaken the meaning of my words, and therefore it is very probable that he may have as much miſtaken yours; and I ſhall not oblige my ſelf to anſwer any other meaning then your own.</p>
